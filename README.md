## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Go to https://github.com/rgiosa10/sql-cr.git to find the specific repository for this website.
* Then open your terminal. I recommend going to your Desktop directory:
    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```
* Then clone the repository by inputting: 
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rgiosa10/sql-cr.git
  ```
* Go to the new directory or open the directory folder on your desktop:
  ```bash
  cd python-adv-cr
  ```
* Once in the directory you will need to set up a virtual environment in your terminal:
  ```bash
  python3.7 -m venv venv
  ```
* Then activate the environment:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
* Install the necessary items with requirements.txt:
  ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* With your virtual environment now enabled with proper requirements, open the directory:
  ```bash
  code .
  ```
